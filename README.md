# MDENet Education Competition 2024

## Getting started

Use this repository to create and store your MDE learning activity (or activities). 
We've set up an initial [activity specification](activity.json).
Use this to define your activity and add any files you need to the repository, possibly including any project folders etc.
You could even include GitHub Actions to support autograding and similar activities, if you wanted.
Learn more about writing activity specifications on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/mdenet/educationplatform/wiki/Creating-an-Activity).

You may wish to set up a local copy of the education platform.
You can learn how to do this by cloning [education-platform-docker](https://github.com/mdenet/educationplatform-docker).
That repository also has links to a Wiki and to the core code repositories for the platform.

We are working on a publicly available hosted version of the platform and will eventually expect all activities to work with this publicly hosted version.
In particular, this means that in your final submission, any tool URLs need to point to a publicly accessible server, whether hosted by MDENet, by yourself, or by someone else.

Once the publicly hosted version is available, you should be able to try out your activity using this link: `https://educationplatform.mde-network.org/?activities=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdenet-education-competition-2023/<YOUR_REPO_NAME_HERE>/main/activity.json&privaterepo=true`.

## What to include

Beyond the files needed for running the activity, please also provide a description of what the activity is about, its context, and what you expect students to do and learn.
You can do this by replacing this README file with one specific to your activity.

## Where to ask for help

For any problems with or questions about the education platform, please submit an issue on the relevant repository.

## License

This repository is provided under MIT license. 
Please feel free to adjust the license for your specific activity.
However, please note that, as a condition of submitting to the competition, we expect to make all activities and their repositories publicly available no later than August 1, 2024.

## Repository

You will have full administrative control over the repository, so will be able to add others to it, rename it etc.
Please keep the repository in this organisation, or we won't be able to access it when it comes time to judge submitted activities.
